# This project includes two different SLURM scheduler plugins #

# **IPSCHED**

# **AUCSCHED** -- auction based scheduler

# **AUCSCHED2** -- auction based scheduler with gpu ranges support (released version)

# **AUCSCHED3** -- auction based scheduler with gpu ranges support and hierarchical topology support (beta version)
